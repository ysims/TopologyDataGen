# Blender Visualisation

The aim of this script is to allow someone to create data and visualise it in Blender. This might be nicer to look at and quicker to move around than Matplotlib, which can be slow for large voxel grids.

1. Open the `generate.py` script in Blender.

2. Edit the full path and data path variables. The full path is your full system path to this folder. The data path is the data path relative to the full path.

3. Run the script.
