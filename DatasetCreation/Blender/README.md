# Blender Visualisation

The aim of this script is to allow someone to create data and visualise it in Blender. This might be nicer to look at and quicker to move around than matplotlib, which can be slow for large voxel grids.

1. After creating voxel data, move the numpy data file (.npy) to this directory. Rename it to `objects.npy`.

2. Open a new Blender project and save it in this directory.

3. Open the `generate.py` script in Blender and run it.
